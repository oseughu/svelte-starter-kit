## Introduction

Our Svelte starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Svelte frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Svelte applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Svelte combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Svelte starter kit utilizes Svelte 5, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com) component library.
