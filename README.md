# Laravel + Svelte Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our Svelte starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a Svelte frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page Svelte applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of Svelte combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This Svelte starter kit utilizes Svelte 5, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com) component library.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for all Laravel starter kits can be found on the [Laravel website](https://laravel.com/docs/starter-kits).

## Quick Start

Run the following command to set up your Svelte starter kit. Replace `laravel-svelte-proj` with your desired project name.

```bash
laravel new laravel-svelte-proj --using=oseughu/svelte-starter-kit
```
